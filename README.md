# Unit 07 Project: Deliver Me

This web application is designed primarily for expecting parents to help make an informed decision of the best place to deliver.

This application uses a public API with health data of Australian hospitals and draws on data that is relevant to deciding which hospital is best for giving birth. This application also uses latitiude and longditude to compare the location 'searched' by the user to compare the distance between hospitals.
